E-Shopping Site Template (Non-Responsive)
A simple e-commerce website template built with HTML and Tailwind CSS. This template is designed to provide a static layout for a basic e-commerce site. It features a clean and minimal design for showcasing products and services. While it is functional, this template does not include responsiveness for different screen sizes. It is ideal for projects where a fixed layout is required.

Features
Basic Layout: Includes a static navigation bar, product sections, and a footer.
Tailwind CSS: Uses Tailwind CSS for styling with utility-first classes.
Product Display: Simple product grids with images, product descriptions, and call-to-action buttons like "Explore".
Minimal Design: Focused on a clean and straightforward design without additional advanced features. 

Customization
This template is highly customizable. You can modify the HTML structure, replace images, and adjust the text content to fit your needs. Since it's a static design, the layout is fixed and does not adjust for different screen sizes.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the website.
Tailwind CSS: For utility-based styling, making it easy to design a modern layout.
